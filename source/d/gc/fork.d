	 * The order in which locks are taken is important
	 * as taking them in the wrong order will cause
	 * deadlocks.
	 * 
	 * FIXME: At the moment, we only take the lock for
	 *        the collection process. This ensures we
	 *        can use the fork/exec pattern safely, but
	 *        it will nto leave the GC in a usable state
	 *        in the child.
